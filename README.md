Welcome to Olga Kozlova's portfolio of projects in Data Science. 
I am excited to share my very first projects completed as part of professional certifications in Data Science and programming languages (Python and R).  

1. Solution for Logistic Regression is about building a model to predict whether a customer
   will make a claim on their insurance during the policy period through supervised learning.
2. Solution for K-means Clustering is about applying the Priniciple Component Analysis and K-means algorythm
   to assign a population of penguins to three possible species (unsupervised learning).
3. Solution for Lasso Regression, DecisionTreeRegressor, RandomForestRegressor is about performing several regression models to compare resulting MSE (mean squared error)
   scores for the selection of an optimal model (unsupervised learning).
